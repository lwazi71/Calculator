# Description
Made using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, allowing user to use different math functions. Challenges faced were creating backspace after user gets a calculation and not allowing user to divide by zero.
# How to Use
Similar to normal calculators, press operand buttons and number values to get calculation, use backspace if wrong number is selected.
# What I learned
Grid and Flexbox styling, Javascript fundamentals, looping through buttons, changing display based on function calls, storing values and calling them with one function, rounding large numbers, and allowing for multiple calculations.
